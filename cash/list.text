1. At each step use the largest value coin possible doing a Greedy Algorithm
2. Need to ask the user for the amunt of change we own, we should make sure it is a number and it is not negative.
3. Use the largest coins possible and keep track of the coins used
4. Print the number of used/required coins for the change
5. It is important to convert the dollars to cents, to do that
   * Multiply dollars by 100
   *Be sure to round cents to nearest penny, there is a function called round for that in math.h
6. Keep track of remaining change owed.
7. Keep track of how many coins used.
