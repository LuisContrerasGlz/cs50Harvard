Encrypted some text by shifting all of the letter of that text by a certain amount.
Unencrypted text is generally called plaintext. Encrypted text is generally called ciphertext. And the secret used is called a key.

TO DO:
  1. Get Key - the amount we will shift each of the individual letters by
     *Ensure Single command-line argument
     *Make sure argument contains only digit characters
     *Convert argument to an integer
  2. Get PlainText
  3. Encipher
     *If it´s alphabetic, shift plaintext character by key, preserving case
     *If it´s not alphabetic, leave the character as-is
     *We use formula Ci = (Pi + k) % 26
         * ith character of ciphertext
         *ith character of plaintext
         *kEY
         *Remainder when divided by 26
     *Convert ASCII to alphabetical index
     *Shift alphabetiical index using formula
     *Convert result back to ASCII
  4. Print ciphertext
